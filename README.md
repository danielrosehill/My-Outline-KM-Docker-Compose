# Lightly modified Docker Compose for Outline KM (Self-Hosted)

A lightly modified `docker-compose.yml` I used to install a self-hosted outline KM on a public cloud.

The official docker compose (at the time of writing) is [here](https://docs.getoutline.com/s/hosting/doc/docker-7pfeLP5a8t).


## Changes

See `changes.md` nested in `documentation` for a summary of modifications I made to the current `docker-compose.yml` as Outline have it which for reference has been added to `reference.`
